<h1 id="header">Upcycling vs. Recycling</h1>
     
 <section id="intro">
    <div>We are all aware with the idea of recycling, which is the process of repurposing the materials we consume to create new products while conserving resources and energy. Upcycling may also be familiar to you. What does it signify? And what distinguishes recycling from upcycling?</div><br>
    <div>Reusing materials may be done in two major ways: upcycling and recycling. Recycling transforms waste resources into fresh ones that may be utilised to make new goods. Upcycling is the process of taking old materials and turning them into something better and newer than before.</div><br>
    <div>Although the phrases upcycling and recycling have virtually minor differences, they both refer to a greater awareness of our consumer choices and obligations about what we do with our belongings once we've used them.</div><br></br>

 <section id="Up">   
         <div class="upc">• Upcycling is the process of taking already-existing materials or items and turning them into something better, sometimes with a whole new purpose.</div><br>
         <div class="upc">• Maximising the potential of discarded things while minimising waste is the main objective of upcycling.</div>
    <h3 class="upc">What Can Be Upcycled?</h3>
        <div class="upc">One common upcycled "material" is old and outdated furniture.  Sanding, painting, and installing new handles are quick and simple ways to refurbish a cabinet or chest of drawers.</div><br>
        <div class="upc">Upcycling is more than simply making things better versions of themselves; they are often reused to fulfil whole other purposes.</div><br>
        <div class="upc">For instance, plastic bottles may be used to create a number of products, such as a bird feeder, a watering can, a plant container, a face visor, and fairy lights.</div><br>
        <div class="upc">Tops may be weaved together to form shopping bags or plant holders, and worn jeans can be used to construct backpacks. Additionally, a single dress can be made into two separate pieces.</div><br>
    <h3 class="upc">What Cannot Be Upcycled?</h3>
        <div class="upc">Despite repurposing and any efforts to update and improve, there are restrictions on what may be recycled. Items that contain hazardous ingredients, such as foam that is deadly when burned, or that are beyond repair and harmful to use.</div><br>
        <div class="upc">Recycling is a preferable choice when you are positive that an item has to be broken down and reformed since it is no longer usable in its current state. Metals like copper and aluminium, for example, may be more valuable when recycled than when upcycled and used as paperweights or artwork.</div><br>

<section class="Re">
        <div class="Rec">• Contrarily, recycling entails disassembling waste items into their constituent parts (such as plastic bottles into plastic pellets) and then utilising those parts to make new goods.</div><br>
        <div class="Rec">• Recycling saves resources and lessens trash, but it frequently uses a lot of energy and might produce lower-quality goods.</div>
        <h3 class="Rec">What Can Be Recycled?</h3>
        <div class="Rec">Paper products, such as office paper, cardboard, magazines, and newspapers, may generally be recycled. It is also possible to recycle some plastics, glass from bottles and containers, and metals from cans composed of steel, aluminium, and tin. Simply ensure that they are sanitised and devoid of food particles and other impurities.</div><br>
        <div class="Rec">Concrete, steel, aluminium, plastics (including PET, PP, PBT, and PLA), textiles, wood, glass, and paper are among the materials that are frequently recycled.</div><br>
    <h3 class="Rec">What Cannot Be Recycled?</h3>
        <div class="Rec">Unfortunately, although many things are easily recyclable, others are not. This is due to the fact that they are either excessively polluted or, for financial reasons, not constructed from recyclable materials. </div><br>
        <div class="Rec">For instance, recycling plastics used to hold food packaging or bathroom hygiene items like toothpaste would cost more money and energy than recycling the raw virgin material. Because they are mostly air and often polluted, some foams, like polystyrene, are costly and challenging to recycle.</div><br>
        <div class="Rec">Additionally, because it is hard or time-consuming to separate, it is challenging to recycle products that heavily incorporate mixed materials into its function or feature. For instance, it can be challenging to separate <br>dual-material items, such as glossy paperboard materials used to hold meals or liquids, or mixed-plastic products since the plastics may need distinct processing.</div>
