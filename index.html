<section id="main-content">
    <div> <p>Upcycling is the reuse of wasted materials to create new “value” to old items. Creative upcycling may have the ability to establish communities of makers and <br>re-establish connections between people and materials. It may be argued that designing to facilitate creative upcycling has the potential to provide broad social, economic, and environmental advantages by allowing the future lives of things to depend on context and culture rather than the designer's prescription. Upcycling provides opportunities for people and organisations to benefit the environment while savouring the results of their inventiveness. Think about upcycling the next time you encounter an old object that looks to be beyond its best and witness it change into something precious and fresh right in front of your eyes.</p></div>

<section id="keyPoints">
    <div class="keyPoints">• Upcycling is a significant and useful strategy for sustainability, not merely a trendy catchphrase. We lessen waste, preserve resources, and stimulate innovation by giving outdated and abandoned objects new life.<br></br>
        • Upcycling is essential to reframing our connection with the things we use, throw away, and change as we work towards a more sustainable future.</div><br></br>
