<section id="main-content">
    <div> <p>Short ‘product lives’ and disposable packaging result in premature disposal of valuable resources. Industrialization, mass production and global supply chains have resulted in a disconnect between people, places, materials and design. Upcycling is reuse of discarded materials which results in an increase in ‘value’. We discuss the potential for creative upcycling to reconnect people with materials and establish cultures and communities of making. The reaction of the public to creative reuse is explored by creating a café structure made entirely from recycled materials, and this provides the starting point to consider the contexts in which upcycling occurs, the motivations for reuse and upcycling, the potential benefits of upcycling in the context of affluent Western 'consumer' societies, and the scope for designers to imbue objects with the potential for creative reuse. We argue that designing to enable creative upcycling allows the future lives of objects to be contingent on context and culture, rather than being prescribed by the designer, with potential for widespread social, economic and environmental benefits.</p></div>

<!-- <p>At its core, upcycled products are a creative and eco-friendly means of reusing materials or items to grant them a fresh lease of life, elevating their value.
Unlike recycling, where materials are broken down to their raw form before being reprocessed into a new product, upcycling focuses on transforming an item without degrading its quality. It’s about taking something old, worn, or discarded and turning it into something of higher value or purpose.</p> -->
    <div class="keyPoints">• Upcycling is not just a trendy buzzword; it’s a meaningful and practical approach to sustainability. By breathing new life into old and discarded items, we reduce waste, conserve resources, and inspire creative thinking.</div>
    <div class="keyPoints">• Upcycling offers countless possibilities for individuals and businesses to make a positive impact on the environment while enjoying the fruits of their creativity.</div>
    <div class="keyPoints">• As we move toward a more sustainable future, upcycling plays a crucial role in redefining our relationship with the items we use, discard, and transform.</div>  
    <div class="keyPoints">• The next time you come across an old item that seems past its prime, consider the art of upcycling, and watch it transform into something new and valuable before your eyes.</div>
