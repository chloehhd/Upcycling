    <section id="main-content">
        <div><p>Upcycling helps to minimize waste, limit the demand for new materials and conserve energy. This can reduce air pollution, water pollution and climate-heating emissions. Beyond the direct benefits for the planet, upcycling supports a circular economy and fosters creativity and innovation in sustainable design. </p>
        <p>Before throwing something out, consider how it can be repurposed. Start small, perhaps by turning empty tins into plant pots or personalizing an old piece of clothing.</p></div>
